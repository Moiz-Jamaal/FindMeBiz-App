# Google Logo Asset Required

Please add a Google logo image file as:
`assets/images/google_logo.png`

Recommended specifications:
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Size: 24x24 pixels (or higher resolution like 48x48, 72x72)
- Background: Transparent
- Style: Official Google "G" logo

You can download the official Google logo from:
https://developers.google.com/identity/branding-guidelines

Alternative: You can use any Google logo image or even a simple text placeholder until you get the official logo.

## Temporary Workaround

If you want to test immediately without the logo, you can replace the Image.asset widget in auth_view.dart with:

```dart
// Replace this line:
icon: Image.asset(
  'assets/images/google_logo.png',
  height: 24,
  width: 24,
),

// With this temporary icon:
icon: const Icon(
  Icons.account_circle,
  color: Colors.blue,
  size: 24,
),
```

This will show a generic account icon until you add the proper Google logo.
